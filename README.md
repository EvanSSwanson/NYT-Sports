# NYT Sports

## Abstract
  - NYT Sports is a small app which displays NYT sports articles and gives a link to view them. This was done as a solo mock-take-home-challenge through Turing, demonstrating my abilities with React, interacting with APIs, and sticking to strict MVPs to stay within a short (8-hour) timeframe.

## Features

## Possible Future Extensions

- Play around with state management
